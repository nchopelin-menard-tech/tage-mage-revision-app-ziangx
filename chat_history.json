[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "i want to create an app to revise the tage mage and the best score possible, i want also a track of my stat on the revision "}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand. You want to create an app to revise the Tage Mage, track your best scores, and keep track of your revision stats. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen/Dashboard:** A welcoming screen that displays the app's purpose, your best score, and a summary of your revision stats.\n-   **Revision Section:** A dedicated section where you can access practice questions or revision materials for the Tage Mage.\n-   **Stats Tracking:** Implement a system to record your scores and revision activity, providing insights into your progress.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#3f51b5` (Indigo, a calming and intellectual color)\n    *   Secondary: `#e91e63` (Pink, for highlights and accents)\n    *   Accent: `#64ffda` (Teal, a vibrant color to draw attention)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#ffc107` (Amber, for important elements)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify the Home Screen:**\n    *   Update `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to display the user's best score and a summary of their revision stats. This will likely involve adding new components or modifying existing ones to display this information. The `modalDemos` array should be removed from this file.\n2.  **Create Revision Section:**\n    *   Add a new screen or modify an existing one (perhaps within the tabs) to house the revision materials or practice questions. This might involve creating new components for displaying questions and answers.\n3.  **Implement Stats Tracking:**\n    *   Introduce a mechanism to store and retrieve revision data (scores, time spent, etc.). Since Supabase is available, we could use it for this, but let's start by storing the data locally within the app using React state or AsyncStorage.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user. After that, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T21:09:15.769967"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a Tage Mage revision app with score tracking and statistics!
